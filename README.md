# Python File Handling Assignment

This repository contains a Python script for a file handling assignment. The script performs the following tasks:

1. **File Creation:** Creates a new text file named "my_file.txt" and writes some initial content to it.
2. **File Reading and Display:** Reads the contents of "my_file.txt" and displays them on the console.
3. **File Appending:** Opens "my_file.txt" in append mode and appends additional lines of text to it.
4. **Error Handling:** Implements error handling to manage potential file-related exceptions.

## Instructions

Follow these steps to run the Python script:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/EdithAugustine/python-file-handling-assignment.git

2. Navigate to the directory containing the Python script:
cd python-file-handling-assignment

3. Run the Python script:
python file_handling_assignment.py


## File Structure

- `file_handling_assignment.py`: Python script containing the file handling code.
- `my_file.txt`: Text file created and manipulated by the Python script.

## Error Handling

The script implements error handling using try, except, and finally blocks to manage potential file-related exceptions such as FileNotFoundError and PermissionError.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it as needed!
